From experience, association direc- tors believed there was a significant difference in the average cost of a gallon of pre- mium gasoline among urban areas in different parts of the country. To test this belief, they placed random calls to gasoline stations in five different cities. In addition, the researchers realized that the brand of gasoline might make a difference. They were mostly interested in the differences between cities, so they made city their treatment variable. To control for the fact that pricing varies with brand, the researchers included brand as a blocking variable and selected six different brands to participate. The researchers randomly telephoned one gasoline station for each brand in each city, resulting in 30 measurements (five cities and six brands). Each station operator was asked to report the current cost of a gallon of premium unleaded gasoline at that station. The data are shown here. Test these data by using a randomized block design analysis to determine whether there is a significant difference in the average cost of premium unleaded gasoline by city.

Because the age of the child may have an effect on the study, parents are asked to focus on one particular child in the family for the week, and to report the age of the child. Four age categories are selected for the children: 4–5 years, 6–7 years, 8–9 years, and 10–12 years. Also, because the number of children in the family might make a difference, three different sizes of families are chosen for the study: families with one child, families with two children, and families with three or

37,"The Construction Labor Research Council lists a number of construction labor jobs that seem to pay approximately the same wages per hour. Some of these are bricklaying, iron working, and crane operation. Suppose a labor researcher takes a random sample of workers from each of these types of construction jobs and from across the country and asks what are their hourly wages. If this survey yields the following data, is there a significant difference in mean hourly wages for these three jobs? If there is
a significant difference, use the Anova procedure to determine which pairs, if any, are also significantly different. Let alpha = 0.05",Job Type,,,,,,,,0.05,One Way CRD

38,"Why are mergers attractive to CEOs? One of the reasons might be a potential increase in market share that can come with the pooling of company markets. Suppose a random survey of CEOs is taken, and they
are asked to respond on a scale from 1 to 5 (5 representing strongly agree) whether increase in market share is a good reason for considering a merger of their company with another. Suppose also that the data are as given here and that CEOs have been categorized by size of company and years they have been with their company. Use a two-way ANOVA to determine whether there are any significant differences in the responses to this question. Let alpha = 0.05",,,Company Size ($ million per year in sales),,,,,,0.05,Two Way FD

40,"Pipeline operators estimate that it costs between $75 and $500 in U.S. currency to replace each seal, thus making the Clarkson longer-lasting valves more attractive. Tyco does business with pipeline companies around the world. Suppose in an attempt to develop marketing materials, Tyco marketers are interested in determining whether there is a significant difference in the cost of replacing pipeline seals in different countries. Four countrie Canada, Colombia, Taiwan, and the United States are chosen for the study. Pipeline operators from equivalent operations are selected from companies in each country. The operators keep a cost log of seal replacements. A random sample of the data follows. Use these data to help Tyco determine whether there is a difference in the cost of seal replacements in the various countries. Explain your answer and tell how Tyco might use the information in their marketing materials.",Canada,Colombia,Taiwan,United States,,,,,0.05,One Way CRD

Using this and other quality improvement approaches, the company was able to reduce lead-time from six to eight weeks to less than two weeks. Suppose that Tyco now uses a similar system and wants to test to determine whether lead-times differ significantly according to the type of valve it is manufacturing. As a control of the experiment, they are including in the study, as a blocking variable, the day of the week the valve was ordered. One lead-time was selected per valve per day of the week. The data are given here in weeks. Analyze the data and discuss your findings.",,Type of Valve,,,,,,,0.01,One Way RBD
