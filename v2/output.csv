Suppose a national travel association studied the cost of premium unleaded gasoline in the United States during the summer of 2010. From experience association direc- tors believed there was a significant difference in the average cost of a gallon of pre- mium gasoline among urban areas in different parts of the country. To test this belief they placed random calls to gasoline stations in five different cities. In addition the researchers realized that the brand of gasoline might make a difference. They were mostly interested in the differences between cities so they made city their treatment variable. To control for the fact that pricing varies with brand the researchers included brand as a blocking variable and selected six different brands to participate. The researchers randomly telephoned one gasoline station for each brand in each city resulting in 30 measurements (five cities and six brands). Each station operator was asked to report the current cost of a gallon of premium unleaded gasoline at that station. The data are shown here. Test these data by using a randomized block design analysis to determine whether there is a significant difference in the average cost of premium unleaded gasoline by city.

"Safety in motels and hotels is a growing concern among travelers. Suppose a survey
was conducted by the National Motel and Hotel Association to determine U.S.
travelers’ perception of safety in various motel chains. The association chose four
different national chains from the economy lodging sector and randomly selected 
10 people who had stayed overnight in a motel in each of the four chains in the past
two years. Each selected traveler was asked to rate each motel chain on a scale from 
0 to 100 to indicate how safe he or she felt at that motel. A score of 0 indicates
completely unsafe and a score of 100 indicates perfectly safe. The scores follow. Test

Suppose a survey was undertaken to ascertain whether the perception of economic
recovery differs according to political affiliation. People were selected for the survey
from the Democratic Party the Republican Party and those classifying themselves
as independents. A 25-point scale was developed in which respondents gave a score
of 25 if they felt the economy was definitely in complete recovery a 0 if the economy
was definitely not in a recovery and some value in between for more uncertain
responses. To control for differences in socioeconomic class a blocking variable was

"Children are generally believed to have considerable influence over their parents in the purchase of certain items particularly food and beverage items. To study this notion further a study is conducted in which parents are asked to report how many food and beverage items purchased by the family per week are purchased mainly because of the influence of their children. Because the age of the child may have an effect on the study parents are asked to focus on one particular child in the family for the week and to report the age of the child. Four age categories are selected for the children: 4–5 years 6–7 years 8–9 years and 10–12 years. Also because the number of children in the family might make a difference three different sizes of families are chosen for the study: families with one child families with two children and families with three or

Suppose in an attempt to develop marketing materials Tyco marketers are interested in determining whether there is a significant difference in the cost of replacing pipeline seals in different countries. Four countrie Canada Colombia Taiwan and the United States are chosen for the study. Pipeline operators from equivalent operations are selected from companies in each country. The operators keep a cost log of seal replacements. A random sample of the data follows. Use these data to help Tyco determine whether there is a difference in the cost of seal replacements in the various countries.
